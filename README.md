This game was created for the DokiBird GameJam! We did what we could with the two weeks we were given, even though we had a tough schedule to work around, I am impressed with my team and I. With what we had going on in life, I think we did a pretty good job making this work! This game was created using ducktape and love, sure there are some bugs here and there, we continue to make this game better over time as a side project. I am happy to have contributed to the DokiBird GameJam! - Bleu
